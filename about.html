		        	My name's Prince Sadie. I enjoy exploring web design, interested in game development, and am a huge Game of Thrones fan! Welcome!

			        Prior to joining Dev Bootcamp, I spent most of my time taking college classes and learning game development on my own. I used a super easy platform called GM:Studio to a get taste of programming and put up my games on my site. I'm originally from the Philippines. When I'm not trying to become a developer, you're likely to find me playing a MOBA, getting lost on Reddit, or exploring new eateries with friends.

				    A quirky thing about me is that I enjoy to take drives late at night to zone out, listen to music, and clear my head.
