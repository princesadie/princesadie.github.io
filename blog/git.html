  <h1>How I Learned to Git</h1>

      So this is week 1 of Dev Bootcamp's Phase 0 and I've learned several things I didn't know before. I've learned how to actually use my command line. Prior to this I simply copied and pasted from the web whenever the need arose and just put faith in the commands people were giving me. Now I can actually, albeit not master level, understand what such commands do - somewhat. One of things I got most excited to say I know how to use now is git and GitHub.

        I've made several games in the past with GM:S and I've always kept my project files local or on Dropbox for those times I may not have access to my home pc. I practiced a sort of "version control" before I even knew what actual "version control" was by appending my main project folder with v1, v2, etc. It was effective for what I was doing, but I did run into issues like accidentally deleting or overwriting important files without a backup or running into game breaking bugs in which I didn't have an appropriate v# backup. I knew almost from the start that GitHub existed but like many people out there didn't truly know what it was for. I knew it was some collaborative system in which the real programmers hammered out their projects. I wasn't a programmer, just a dabbler in the programming world so I never ventured into GitHub. Heck, I didn't even know what the difference between git and GitHub was. But now I do, and I get just how useful it is.

        Version control allows developers to know what, when, and where changes to their code was made. Git and GitHub allow for multiple developers to share in the development of a project without stepping on each other's toes too much. The simplified work flow goes as follows:
        1.) Pull the latest version of your work from GitHub.
        2.) Create a copy or a branch to work within.
        3.) Once you've finished work, save or commit the changes.
        4.) Push the committed branch or the saved work to GitHub.
        5.) Pull it from GitHub's website and merge it.
        6.) Back on local, shift back to master branch and pull so that the local master is updated.
        7.) Clean up by deleting the branches from GitHub and locally.
        8.) Win.

        Pretty awesome resources from people who explain a thousand times better than I could.
