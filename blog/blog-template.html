-How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  Wireframing with a partner was a lot less tedious than I expected. My partner and I had very similar ideas and connected pretty easily so that definitely helped.
-Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  I'm not quite certain I enjoy wireframing nor do I find it extremely helpful, but I understand its merits. I probably would wireframe for more complicated projects.
-What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
  We used pretty much a combined version of our individual wireframes. It included a persistent navbar, social links navbar, main blog content area, and a footer.
-What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
  Not really any new semantics, but definitely got practice with the current ones that I know. I've still got to master when, where, and how to use <section>, <article>, and <aside>.
