      <h1>How I Learned to Git</h1>
      <h2>December 6, 2015</h2>
      <p>
        So this is week 1 of Dev Bootcamp's Phase 0 and I've learned several things I didn't know before. I've learned how to actually use my command line. Prior to this I simply copied and pasted from the web whenever the need arose and just put faith in the commands people were giving me. Now I can actually, albeit not master level, understand what such commands do - somewhat. One of things I got most excited to say I know how to use now is git and GitHub.

          I've made several games in the past with GM:S and I've always kept my project files local or on Dropbox for those times I may not have access to my home pc. I practiced a sort of "version control" before I even knew what actual "version control" was by appending my main project folder with v1, v2, etc. It was effective for what I was doing, but I did run into issues like accidentally deleting or overwriting important files without a backup or running into game breaking bugs in which I didn't have an appropriate v# backup. I knew almost from the start that GitHub existed but like many people out there didn't truly know what it was for. I knew it was some collaborative system in which the real programmers hammered out their projects. I wasn't a programmer, just a dabbler in the programming world so I never ventured into GitHub. Heck, I didn't even know what the difference between git and GitHub was. But now I do, and I get just how useful it is.

      <p>
          Version control allows developers to know what, when, and where changes to their code was made. Git and GitHub allow for multiple developers to share in the development of a project without stepping on each other's toes too much. The simplified work flow goes as follows:
          <br><br>
          <p>1.) Pull the latest version of your work from GitHub.</p><br>
          <p>2.) Create a copy or a branch to work within.</p><br>
          <p>3.) Once you've finished work, save or commit the changes.</p><br>
          <p>4.) Push the committed branch or the saved work to GitHub.</p><br>
          <p>5.) Pull it from GitHub's website and merge it.</p><br>
          <p>6.) Back on local, shift back to master branch and pull so that the local master is updated.</p><br>
          <p>7.) Clean up by deleting the branches from GitHub and locally.</p><br>
          <p>8.) Win.</p>
      </p>

          Pretty awesome resources from people who explain a thousand times better than I could.
