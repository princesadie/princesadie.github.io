				<h1>WEEK 6</h1>
				<h2 class="orange">CLASSES IN RUBY</h2>
				<h3>JANUARY 16, 2016</h3>
				<p>
				  Definition from the doc.
				</p>
				<p>
				  <b>Classes in Ruby are first-class objects---each is an instance of class <i>Class</i>.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
				  I like to think of classes as blueprints from which many objects can be modeled. For example, take a <i>Class Animal</i> with <i>@brain, @number_of_legs</i> as an instance variable and <i>move and still</i> as methods.
				</p>
				<pre>
				Class Animal
					def initialize(num_of_legs)
						@brain = true
						@number_of_legs = num_of_legs
						@speed = 0
					end

					def move
						if @number_of_legs <= 0
							@speed = 1
						else
							@speed = 2
						end
					end

					def breathe
						if @brain = true
							p "I can breathe!"
						end
					end
				end
				</pre>
				<p>
				  I think of instance variables as attributes/characteristics that every object created from the class automatically gets and is accessible by every method in the class. Think of methods as the actions that the object can do, in this case our <i>Animal</i> can move and breathe.
				</p>
				<pre>
					human = Animal.new(2)
					human.breathe => "I can breathe!"
				</pre>
				<p>
				  The above code would create a <i>human</i> from the <i>Animal</i> class and it would initialize with two legs. What if we wanted a four legged pig? Coming right up!
				</p>
				<pre>
					pig = Animal.new(4)
					pig.breathe => "I can breathe!"
				</pre>
				<p>
				  It's as simple as that. Once we define our class, we can create as many different objects from that class as we want. We can even make something ridiculous like a horse with 10 legs.
				</p>
				<pre>
					horse = Animal.new(10)
				</pre>
				<p>
				  We can even take it a step further and create a whole new subclass underneath our <i>Animal</i> class and instill it with a new set of variables.
				</p>
				<pre>
				  Class Pet < Animal
				  	def initialize(num_of_legs)
				  		@num_of_legs = num_of_legs
				  	end

				  	def play
				  		puts "I can play!"
				  	end
				  end

				  dog = Pet.new(4)
				  dog.breathe => "I can breathe!"
				  dog.play => "I can play!"
				</pre>
				<p>
				  Can you see that our new <i>Pet</i> subclass has only one method <i>play</i>? Our new dog can still breathe despite us not writing that method out in this new subclass because it inherits the "ability" or method from it's parent class <i>Animal</i>.
				</p>
				<p>
				  That was a super rough explanation of Classes in Ruby. Take a look at Stackoverflow and the docs for a wealth of information and awesome explanations for further reading!
